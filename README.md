## Description

This book search engine application leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and integrates Apollo Server with GraphQL. Originally built with a RESTful API, it has been refactored to use GraphQL, enhancing performance and efficiency. The app allows users to search for books via the Google Books API, save their favorites, and manage their selections. It includes features like user authentication, saved book management, and is deployed on Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
